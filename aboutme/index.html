    <p> At last I have completed my "About Me" assignment! 
        I had a very busy week at work last wek and only started
        on this project yesterday. Needed a little help from grandchildren
        to edit my photo (it came out so large on the page the hairs on my 
        arms were clearly visible!). So this is a little about me:-
    </p>
    <p> Born England 1946. Joined church in New Zealand 1969
        In my second marriage, my wfe and I were responsible 
        for bringing up 9 children (5 mine, 4 hers) oldest 13, 
        youngest 2 - a real life Brady Bunch! Moved back to England 
        to research family history.
        Started Pathway in 2018 and my online degree in 2019. Currently
        Working on my second certificate.
